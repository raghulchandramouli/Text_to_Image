# Text_to_Image

# 1. StableDiffusionPipeline:

The StableDiffusionPipeline is a module provided by the diffusers library. It is specifically designed for image-generation tasks. This pipeline leverages pre-trained models to generate images based on textual prompts.

# 2. Importing dependencies

`import torch`
`from torch import autocast`
`from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline`

In this step, we import the necessary libraries. torch is PyTorch, a popular deep-learning library. auto-cast is a PyTorch feature that allows for automatic mixed precision training, which can help improve performance and memory usage. Finally, we import the StableDiffusionPipeline.
